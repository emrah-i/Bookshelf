<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>This project was developed with the primary goal of showcasing the books I've read and my reading list while gaining proficiency with <b>Flask</b> and its associated components along the way. While the backend of the application involved the use of various tools, the frontend was intentionally kept straightforward. I made the deliberate choice to rely on Bootstrap rather than plain CSS to enhance my comfort with the framework. The application features a basic and modern design, intentionally avoiding an abundance of complex features, as the core idea behind the project was to create a user-friendly digital bookshelf. All of the tools employed in crafting this app include:
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Flask</li>
  <li>Flask-WTForms</li>
  <li>Flask-Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Flask-SQLAlchemy</li>
  <li>PostGres</li>
  <li>BeautifulSoup</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Boostrap</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Front End:</h3>
<p>The front end was primarily crafted with <b>Bootstrap.</b> This choice was made to become more comfortable with this popular framework. When building a project, I tend not to rely on frameworks too much as I feel they can complicate matters too much. However, with a tool like <b>Bootstrap</b>, it can save hours of time when it comes to adding responsiveness and proper functionality. It takes some practice to really learn but once you understand it, it becomes an invaluable tool in your toolbox. The main features of <b>Boostrap</b> utilized for this project was containers, rows, columns, buttons, and page outlines. Aside from <b>Bootstrap</b>, a minimal amount of <b>CSS and JavaScript</b> were used to piece it all together. I chose to keep the front end simple to focus more on implementing the different backend. </p>

<h3>Back End:</h3>
<p>The backend of this project was meticulously crafted using the <b>Flask</b> framework, along with its complementary modules and extensions. Notably, <b>Flask-SQLAlchemy</b> played an integral role in creating the database structure, models, and executing queries. This tool was used due to its ability to streamline all aspects related to database management, simplifying the development process significantly.</p>

<p>In conjunction with SQLAlchemy, <b>Flask-WTForms</b> was employed to establish interactive forms that would be presented on the frontend using the <b>Jinja</b> templating engine. These tools in combination with <b>Flask-BootStrap</b> facilitated the creation of user-friendly interfaces for interacting with the application.</p>

Furthermore, the <b>SMTP</b> Python module was integrated into the project, enabling users to send me book recommendations via email. This feature enhances user engagement and encourages book enthusiasts to share their literary discoveries with ease.</p>
